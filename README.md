# Recommendations

This project uses the yelp-fusion API to give a simple recommendation on where to go based off location and price level. The results displayed give information about the recommended place's rating and the given number of reviews the rating is based off of, and the distance in meters from the API. The results also uses the Google Maps API to display the recommended place. 

This project uses a Node.js server to handle calls to the API and uses ejs to render the results.
